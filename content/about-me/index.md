<!--Introduction -->
# Hey there!
I'm Jairo! I'm currently studying / absolving an apprenticeship as an **Computer Scientist Platform Dev in Switzerland**. I'm passionate about making **open-source** more accessible, creating scripts 💻 and tools to help people. Do ⭐  my repository if you find my project interesting, at least your star could make someone's day.

### 💼 Things that I'm currently working on
* Learning PowerShell and Python 💻
* Learning about different OS (Windows, MacOS, Linux Distros like Arch, RHEL etc).
* Looking forward to learn more about CyberSecurity and Server Administration.

### 🌱 Challenges that I’m currently challenging myself
Since I don't have alot of time because of my apprenticeship and sports (basketball) I usually take 1h - 2h a day to learn anything that I like to learn at the moment. I'm really interested in Linux, PowerShell, Python, CyberSecurity, Home Lab etc. I set a couple of self-challenges in order to push myself more further.🏃

* Learn to code 👨‍💻 : 1-2 hours a day with no distraction ( One or two day off a week. ) 
* Read 📰 News about new Technology and IT
* Basketball Practice 🏀 2 times in a week
* Pursuing an english course to achieve the C1 Certificate
* Adapting and Improving my life style
