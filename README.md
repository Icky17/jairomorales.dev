## Local development

To try my website with hugo, you first need to install:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

To deploy it locally, try and run the following command:

```shell
$ hugo server --disableFastRender
```

You should then see in the terminal, that the website will be deployed in `localhost:1313`.
